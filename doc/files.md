# Bitcoin data directory

**WARNING: All wallet files (`database/*`, `db.log` and `wallet.dat`) can contain private keys. They should not be shared!**

**WARNING: Files in the data directory store information which could be harmful for privacy (eg IP addresses, transaction timestamps, etc). Think carefully before sharing them.**

bitcoind and bitcoin-qt store their files in a data directory, which by default is located at:

* Unix: `~/.bitcoin`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin`
* Windows Vista and later: `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin`
* Windows before Vista: `C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data\Bitcoin`

The location of the data directory can be specified using the `-datadir` command line option.

If no data directory exists when bitcoind is started, it will create a new data directory.

## Data directory files

The data directory contains the following files:

#### Blockchain and transaction state files:
* `blocks/blk000??.dat` - block data (custom, 128 MiB per file); since 0.8.0
* `blocks/index/*` - block index (LevelDB); since 0.8.0
* `blocks/rev000??.dat` - block undo data (custom); since 0.8.0
* `chainstate/*` - block chain state database (LevelDB); since 0.8.0
* `fee_estimates.dat` - stores statistics used to estimate minimum transaction fees and priorities required for confirmation; since 0.10.0
* `mempool.dat` - dump of the mempool's transactions written on shutdown, used to restore the mempool on startup; since 0.14.0

#### Network configuration and state files:
* `banlist.dat` - stores the IPs/Subnets of banned nodes
* `onion_private_key` - cached Tor hidden service private key for `-listenonion`; since 0.12.0
* `peers.dat` - peer IP address database (custom format); since 0.7.0

#### Wallet files:
* `database/*` - wallet database logs. Flushed to `wallet.dat` on shutdown; `database/*` was used for databases (blockchain and network state) before 0.8.0
* `db.log` - wallet database log file
* `wallet.dat` - personal wallet (BDB) with keys and transactions

#### Configuration files:
* `bitcoin.conf` - contains configuration settings for bitcoind or bitcoin-qt

#### Log files:
* `debug.log` - contains debug information and general logging generated by bitcoind or bitcoin-qt

#### Ephemeral files (deleted on shutdown):
* `.cookie` - session RPC authentication cookie (written at start when cookie authentication is used, deleted on shutdown); since 0.12.0
* `bitcoind.pid` - stores the process id of bitcoind while running

#### Alternative chain directories:

There are two special modes for running bitcoind and bitcoin-qt on test networks. `-testnet` is an alternative network to the main bitcoin network with no monetary value. `-regtest` is used for running a local test network. Data files for those modes are stored in subdirectories of the main data directory, and their layout is exactly the same as the main data directory:

* `testnet3/*` - contains data files for running bitcoind or bitcoin-qt on testnet.
* `regtest/*` - contains data files for running bitcoind or bitcoin-qt in regtest mode.

## Old data directory files

The following files were used by old versions of bitcoind and bitcoin-qt:

#### Only used before 0.8.0
* `blkindex.dat` - block chain index database (BDB); replaced by `chainstate/*`, `blocks/index/*` and `blocks/rev000??.dat` in 0.8.0
* `blk000?.dat` - block data (custom, 2 GiB per file); replaced by `blocks/blk000??.dat` in 0.8.0

#### Only used before 0.7.0
* `addr.dat` - peer IP address database (BDB); replaced by `peers.dat` in 0.7.0
